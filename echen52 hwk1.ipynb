Then, you will write the tokenization algorithm. This takes in a sentence and returns its tokenization based on the vocabulary.\n","\n","Your code for this section will all be in the `WordPieceTokenizer` class, where you will implement several functions.\n","\n","### Training algorithm\n","\n","WordPiece learns a token vocabulary in an iterative fashion. Starting with an initial token vocabulary (the set of characters in the training data), each step merges a pair of consecutive tokens, where the pair of tokens is selected according to a scoring function (described below). The process is continued until a desired `vocab_size` is reached.\n","\n","You will complete this algorithm by implementing several functions in the `WordPieceTokenizer` class:\n","\n","1. **`initialize(self, train_corpus)`: [6 points]** This returns the initial vocabulary, the initial tokenization of each word, the word frequncies, and a mapping from each token to the words containing that token. First, split each sentence in `train_corpus` on the space character. The initial vocabulary is the set of all characters that occur in any word; but characters occuring in the middle of a word should be prepended with the special sequence `##`. For example, if your corpus is the sentence `the old man the boat.`, your initial vocabulary would be:\n","<div align=\"center\"><code>{'t', '##h', '##e', 'o', '##l', '##d', 'm', '##a', '##n', 't', 'b', '##o', '##t', '##.'}</code></div>\n","This function should also compute the initial tokenization of each word, storing them in a dictionary from word to tokenization. For example:\n","<div align=\"center\"><code>{'the': ('t', '##h', '##e;), 'old': ('o', '##l', '##d'),                \n","    'man': ('m', '##a', '##n'), 'boat.': ('b', '##o', '##a', '##t', '##.'}\n","</code></div>\n","The function should also count the frequency of each word in the training corpus, and return a mapping from token to the words that use that token. For example:\n","<div align=\"center\"><code>word_freqs = {'the': 100, 'old': 34, 'man': 76, 'boat.': 18}</code></div>\n","    <div align=\"center\"><code>tokens2word = {'t': {'the'}, '##h': {'the'}, '##e': {'the'}, ...}</code></div>\n","\n","2. **`find_best_pair(self, word_tokenizations, word_freqs, vocab)`: [6 points]** This function computes a score for each *consecutive pair* $(t_1, t_2)$ of tokens, and returns the pair of tokens with highest score. The scoring function is $$\\frac{c(t_1, t_2) \\cdot |V|}{c(t_1)\\cdot c(t_2)}$$where $c(t_1, t_2)$ is the number of times $t_1$ and $t_2$ occur consecutively in the corpus, $c(t_i)$ is the nubmer of times token $t_i$ occurs, and $|V|$ is the size of the current token vocabulary. The function will return the pair with highest score (ties broken alphabetically).\n","\n","    The idea behind the scoring function is that a pair of tokens will have high score if they occur frequently together *and* each token does not occur frequently on its own. Factoring in the size of the vocabulary gives a (slight) preference to longer subword units as the vocabulary size grows.\n","    \n","\n","3. **`merge_best_pair(self, best_pair, vocab, word_tokenizations, tokens2word)`: [6 points]** This function updates your current vocabulary (`vocab`), tokenizations (`word_tokenizations`), and token-to-word mapping (`tokens2word`) based on the pair of tokens to merge (`best_pair`). The `vocab` should simply be updated to include the new token, and any word in `word_tokenizations` that contains the consecutive pair of tokens should be updated to merge that pair. For example, suppose the pair of tokens to merge is `(##h, ##e)` and `word_tokenizations` is\n","<div align=\"center\"><code>  {'the': ('t', '##h', '##e;), 'old': ('o', '##l', '##d'),                \n","    'man': ('m', '##a', '##n'), 'boat.': ('b', '##o', '##a', '##t', '##.'}</code></div>\n","Then <code>word_tokenizations</code> should be updated to\n","<div align=\"center\"><code>  {'the': ('t', '##he'), 'old': ('o', '##l', '##d'),                      \n","    'man': ('m', '##a', '##n'), 'boat.': ('b', '##o', '##a', '##t', '##.'}</code></div>\n","Similarly, <code>tokens2word</code> should be updated to include the new token:\n","<div align=\"center\"><code>tokens2word['##he'] = {'the'}</code></div>\n","<i>Note:</i> In order to pass the autograder, you should <i>not</i> remove <code>'the'</code> from <code>tokens2word['##h']</code> or <code>tokens2word['##e']</code>, despite the fact that these tokens are no longer used for that word.\n","\n","We provide you the function `train(self, train_corpus, vocab_size)` which iteratively calls these functions until the desired `vocab_size` is hit. You should NOT modify this function, but you should look at it to understand how it works.\n","\n","### Tokenization algorithm\n","\n","Finally, you will write the `tokenize` and `detokenize` functions, which use the token vocabulary you learned to tokenize and detokenize arbitrary sentences:\n","\n","1. **`tokenize(self, sentence)`: [5 points]** This function takes a sentence and returns its tokenization. First, split on the space character. For each word, find the longest substring starting at the beginning of the word that is in the token vocabulary, and choose that token. Then, iteratively repeat this procedure on the remainder of the word, until the entire word is tokenized. For example, consider the word `swiftly`:\n","    * If `s` and `sw` are tokens but `swi` is not, then choose `sw`.\n","    * Then, proceed with `##iftly`. If `##i`, `##if`, and `##ift` are tokens, but `##iftl` is not, choose `##ift`.\n","    * Then, proceed with `##ly`. If both `##l` and `##ly` are tokens, choose `##ly`.\n","\n","  After tokenizing each word in this way, return a list containing the tokenization of each word separated by space tokens.

The token <em>the</em> appears twice in the sentence, but they share the same type <em>the</em>.\n","\n","If $c(w)$ is the frequency of $w$ in the training data, you can compute $P_L(w)$ as follows:\n","\n","$$P_L(w)=\\frac{c(w)+1}{N+S}$$\n","\n","<font color='green'><b>Hints:</b></font>\n","* <font color='green'>You may find it convenient to make your `SmoothedUnigramModel` inherit your `UnigramModel`, and then override the function(s) that need to be changed.</font>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wzX-UZJPfvRn"},"outputs":[],"source":["class SmoothedUnigramModel(UnigramModel):\n","    def __init__(self, trainCorpus):\n","\n","        ### TODO ###\n","        super().__init__(trainCorpus)\n","        token_dict = super().token_dict()\n","        self.p_w = self.token_prob(token_dict)\n","\n","\n","    def token_prob(self, token_dict):\n","\n","        N = sum(token_dict.values())\n","        S= len(token_dict.keys())\n","        pl_w ={}\n","\n","        for key, value in token_dict.items():\n","          pl_w[key] = (value+1)/(N+S)\n","\n","        return pl_w\n","\n","\n","    def generateSentence(self):\n","\n","        ### TODO ###\n","        return super().generateSentence()\n","\n","    def getSentenceLogProbability(self, sentence):\n","\n","        ### TODO ###\n","        return super().getSentenceLogProbability(sentence)\n","\n","    def getCorpusPerplexity(self, testCorpus):\n","\n","        ### TODO ###\n","        return super().getCorpusPerplexity(testCorpus)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":254,"status":"ok","timestamp":1739826517166,"user":{"displayName":"Edward Chen","userId":"02346495629728626876"},"user_tz":360},"id":"rBy9QaEdCUbc","outputId":"fac36bc3-cca0-4c98-a2ca-ce984064ade3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--- TEST: generateSentence() ---\n","Test generateSentence() passed!\n","\n","--- TEST: getSentenceLogProbability(...) ---\n","Correct log prob.: -19.0405293515 \tYour log prob.: -19.0405293515 \t PASSED \t ['<s>', 'Sonic', 'was', 'difficult', '.', '</s>']\n","Correct log prob.: -115.3479413049 \tYour log prob.: -115.3479413049 \t PASSED \t ['<s>', 'By', 'the', 'Late', 'Classic', ',', 'a', 'network', 'of', 'few', '<UNK>', '(', 'few', '<UNK>', ')', 'linked', 'various', 'parts', 'of', 'the', 'city', ',', 'running', 'for', 'several', 'kilometres', 'through', 'its', 'urban', 'core', '.', '</s>']\n","Correct log prob.: -108.9114348746 \tYour log prob.: -108.9114348746 \t PASSED \t ['<s>', 'Few', 'people', 'realize', 'how', 'difficult', 'it', 'was', 'to', 'create', 'Sonic', \"'s\", 'graphics', 'engine', ',', 'which', 'allowed', 'for', 'the', 'incredible', 'rate', 'of', 'speed', 'the', 'game', \"'s\", 'known', 'for', '.', '</s>']\n","Correct log prob.: -54.8190029616 \tYour log prob.: -54.8190029616 \t PASSED \t ['<s>', 'Classic', 'few', 'parts', 'of', 'the', 'game', 'allowed', 'for', 'few', '<UNK>', '<UNK>', 'incredible', 'city', '.', '</s>']\n","Correct log prob.: -55.8122547346 \tYour log prob.: -55.8122547346 \t PASSED \t ['<s>', 'Few', '<UNK>', 'realize', 'the', 'difficult', 'network', ',', 'which', 'linked', 'the', 'game', 'to', 'Sonic', '.', '</s>']\n","Test getSentenceProbability(...) passed!\n","\n","--- TEST: getCorpusPerplexity(...) ---\n","Correct train perp.: 41.9994393615 \tYour train perp.: 41.9994393615 \t PASSED\n","Correct test perp.: 39.9531928383 \tYour test perp.: 39.9531928383 \t PASSED\n","Test getCorpusPerplexity(...) passed!\n"]}],"source":["if __name__=='__main__':\n","    sanityCheck('smoothed-unigram')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pxeKnWk1TTfF"},"source":["Since the next sanity check trains your model on the *entire* training set, you will likely see that it is taking too long if you have inefficiences in your code.
