We also need to enumerate each possible transition, and map it to an id, since this is what our neural network will try to predict. The `Vocabulary` class does this as follows. Suppose there are $n$ labels. For each label, we create a Left-Arc (LA) and Right-Arc (RA) action for that label; and we also create a separate Shift (S) action. This creates a total of $2n+1$ actions that our dependency parser will be able to choose from.\n",

We certainly hope that the model will not do this, but we cannot guarantee this for an unseen sentence, and so have to account for the possibility at inference time.\n",

    "Thus, you should return the highest probability <b>legal</b> action for each parser configuration. Your job is to write a function `select_best_legal_action(parser_configs, predictions, n_labels)` that does exactly this. You have some flexibility in how you choose to implement this.\n",

The second `n_labels` indices `[n_labels,...,2*n_labels-1]` correspond to the `RA-label` actions. The very last index `2*n_labels` corresponds to the `S` action.\n",
    "* For each row of `predictions`, you will want to determine which actions are legal. <b>You will need to think about how to tell which actions are legal based on a parser configuration.</b> Once you know this, we suggest building a bit map of size `2*n_labels+1`, where an index contains a `1` if its corersponding action is legal and a `0` otherwise.\n",
    "* You can then select the best action by either masking out the illegal actions, or by multiplying your bit map by a large number and adding it to the probabilities, so that the `argmax` operation can only return a legal index.\n",
    "* When thinking about which actions are legal, you do not need to worry about whether certain labels should be allowed or not. You just need to focus on when `LA`, `RA`, and `S` are allowed (regardless of whether a particular label makes sense on a particular `LA` or `RA` arc).</font>\n",
